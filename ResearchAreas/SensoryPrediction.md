The prediction of sensory attributes is a critical challenge in the field of cultivated meat, a subfield of cellular agriculture. Consumer acceptance will be driven in part by the taste, smell, and texture of the final products. Artificial intelligence offers one set of tools to address this by modeling the intricate relationship between inputs (cell types, processing, etc) and human perception. By accurately predicting sensory outcomes, AI can accelerate the development of cell-based food products by giving early indications what formulations are most likely to lead to desirable end product properties.

Several research efforts demonstrate the practical application of AI in enhancing food sensory attributes. Sun et al. (2026) leverage machine learning to analyze odor compounds, aiming to improve the sensory quality and control off-flavors in algal foods. Similarly, Du et al. (2025) utilize machine learning to predict volatile compound profiles from yeast fermentation, successfully simulating a meat aroma. Another study by Sun et al. (2023) developed a convolutional neural network to profile off-flavors in salmonids, showcasing a practical use of AI for quality control. These works collectively highlight AI's ability to detect and predict flavor and odor profiles that are either desired or undesirable.

In contrast, Lee et al. (2023) present a more fundamental contribution to understanding olfaction through AI. Their research introduces a Principal Odor Map generated by graph neural networks, which directly maps molecular structure to human odor perception. The aim here is to replace or augment expensive human sensory panels, which can be a cost or time barrier to product formulation and release.
