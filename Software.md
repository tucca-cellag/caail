# Software & Code

This library collects open-source tools that apply computational methods and AI related to cellular agriculture. Be sure to check [Papers](./Papers.md) for code that's associated with a Cellular Agriculture paper.

## Media Optimization & Cell Line Engineering

### [AlphaFold](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold)

Summary: Predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence using deep learning. Can be used for design and engineering of cost-effective recombinant growth factors and signaling molecules. Predicting protein structure helps optimize stability, activity, and binding affinity, reducing the high cost associated with media components.

### [Protein Language Models](https://github.com/ISYSLAB-HUST/Protein-Language-Models)

Summary: This is a collection of links to Protein Language Models, which are models trained to predict structure and function. Can be used for the design and engineering of cost-effective recombinant growth factors and signaling molecules.

### [foldseek](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek)

Summary: Search large protein databases using monomers and multimers. Can be used to find known structures to infer function or guide engineering efforts of a new or target protein.

## Bioprocess Modeling & Scaling
This category includes simulation and modeling tools for optimizing the  bioreactor environment.

### [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/)

Summary: An open-source suite for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Used to model and a variety of environmental factors within bioreactors, to ensure viable conditions at scale.

### [CompuCell3D](https://github.com/CompuCell3D/CompuCell3D)

Summary: A modeling environment for simulating cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. Enables the modeling of complex phenomena like cell proliferation, nutrient gradients within thick tissues, and the mechanics of cells interacting with scaffolds.

### [PhysiCell](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/)

Summary: A physics-based framework specialized for multi-cell simulations. Can be used to model complex cell behaviors, including differentiation and nutrient limitations in tissue cultures.
