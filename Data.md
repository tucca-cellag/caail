# Datasets
This section is a curated list of publicly available data resources related to technical barriers in Cellular Agriculture.

## Genomics & Transcriptomics Data (Raw Cell Line Data)
These sources host fundamental genetic and expression data, applicable to cell line selection and characterization.

### [NIH Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
Summary: A public functional genomics data repository supporting high-throughput gene expression data submission. Can be used to analyze the transcriptional response of cell lines to different culture conditions or media formulations.

### [NIH Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)
Summary: Stores raw sequencing data and alignment information from a variety of cell lines. Enables detailed analysis, such as identifying genetic mutations.

### [NIH GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
Summary: An annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences. Can be used to identify and characterize specific genes (e.g., those governing growth, differentiation, or survival) relevant to the desired cultivated meat cell type.

## Protein & Structure Data
These data sources are helpful for computational tasks related to reducing media cost by analyzing, designing, and optimizing key proteins.

### [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/)
Summary: A comprehensive resource for protein sequence, structure, and functional annotation. May be useful for characterized potential growth factors relevant to cell culture.

### [AlphaFold Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
Summary: A database containing millions of predicted 3D protein structures generated by DeepMind's AlphaFold model. Useful in determining the structural basis for designing stable and active growth factors in cell culture media.
